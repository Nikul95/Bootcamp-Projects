Question by question the project looked at analysing the data and preparing it for analysis. I was able to gain insights from the data by answering these questions correctly and also able to practice my python code using pandas in order to create edit and update different dataframes for this dataset and undertake some calculations where necessary. I learnt a great deal by completing this project and I will continue to utilise the skills I have learnt in this project for future projects that I do in the field of Data Science."]}],"metadata":{"kernel_info":{"name":"python3"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"nteract":{"version":"0.15.0"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"d7b5181b2a1bfaff0f9e58ba5202b6882c5708342b4da446bfb7173aa9a79bc9"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
