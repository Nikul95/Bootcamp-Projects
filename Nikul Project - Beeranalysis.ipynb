I also created a histogram using a SQL query which displayed the distribution of beers around the US. This task was quite good as it helped me to practice the common SQL queries and SQL functions that I would come across when analysing data in a real world application perspective. The 13 project questions gave a great overview of how to do simple data analysis of a dataset using SQL. Overall this project went well and I did not encounter any problems with the questions. I look forward to continuing to build upon my SQL skills using Python in future projects."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
